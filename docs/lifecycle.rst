Life Cycle Management
=====================

Machine learning projects are handled using a typical set of actions applied in a specific
order. This pattern is what we call a *life cycle*. ForML supports two distinct life cycles
depending on the project stage.

.. caution::
   Do not confuse the life cycles with the :ref:`execution mechanism <platform-execution>`. ForML
   projects can be operated in a number of different ways each of which is still subject to a
   particular life cycle.


Iteration Accomplishment
------------------------

The ultimate milestone of each of the life cycles is the point of producing (a new instance of)
the particular :ref:`runtime artifacts <registry-artifacts>`. This concludes the given iteration
and the process can start over and/or transition between the two life cycles back and forth.

.. _lifecycle-generation:

Generation Advancement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whenever the given pipeline is :ref:`trained <workflow-mode>` (incrementally or from scratch)
and/or *tuned*, a new *generation* of its models is produced.

This typically happens to refresh the models using new data while keeping the same pipeline
implementation. Updating the models of the same release allows (if supported by the given models)
to carry the state over from previous generations to the next by incrementally training only on
the new data obtained since the previous training.

Generations get transparently persisted in the model registry as the :ref:`model generation assets
<registry-assets>`.

.. _lifecycle-release:

Release Roll-out
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The milestone of the :ref:`development life cycle <lifecycle-development>` is the roll-out of a new
*release*. It is essentially a new version of the project *code implementation* published for
deployment.

Upon releasing, the :ref:`ForML package <registry-package>` is produced and persisted in the
model registry.

.. caution::
   Given the different implementations, it is not possible to carry over states between generations
   of different releases.

.. _lifecycle-actions:

Life Cycle Actions
------------------

A simplified logical flow of the individual steps and transitions between the two life cycles is
illustrated by the following diagram:

            applyeval -- Metrics --> renew{Renew?} -- No --> apply
            renew -- Yes --> how{How?} -- Refresh --> train
        end

            traineval --> ready{Ready?} -- No --> implement
            ready -- Yes --> release[(Release)] -- Release Roll-out --> train
        end
        init((Init)) --> implement

.. _lifecycle-development:

Development Life cycle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the name suggests, this life cycle is exercised during the project development in the scope of
the :ref:`project source-code <project>` working copy. It is typically managed using the ``forml
project <action>`` :ref:`CLI interface <platform-cli>` as shown below or using the
:class:`runtime.Virtual <forml.runtime.Virtual>` launcher when visited in the :ref:`interactive
mode <interactive>`.

The expected behavior of the particular action depends on the correct :ref:`project setup
<project>`.

.. hint::
   Any :ref:`model generations <lifecycle-generation>` produced within the development life cycle
   are stored using the :class:`Volatile registry
   <forml.provider.registry.filesystem.volatile.Registry>` which is not persistent across multiple
   python sessions.

The development life cycle actions are:

Test
""""

Simply run through the unit tests defined as per the :ref:`testing` framework.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml project test

Evaluate
""""""""

Perform the :ref:`train-test evaluation <evaluation-traintest>` based on the
:ref:`evaluation.py component <project-evaluation>` and report the metrics.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml project eval

Train
"""""

Run the :ref:`project pipeline <project-pipeline>` in the standard :ref:`train-mode
<workflow-mode>`. Even though this will produce a true generation of the defined models, it won't
get persisted across the invocations making this mode useful merely for smoke-testing the
training process (or displaying the task graph on the :class:`Graphviz runner
<forml.provider.runner.graphviz.Runner>`).

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml project train

Release
"""""""

Build and publish the :ref:`release package <registry-package>` into the configured model
registry. This effectively constitutes the :ref:`release roll-out <lifecycle-release>` and the
process can transition from here into the :ref:`production life cycle <lifecycle-production>`.

.. warning::
   Each :ref:`model registry <registry>` provider allows uploading only unique monotonically
   increasing releases per any given project, hence executing this action twice against the
   same registry without incrementing the :ref:`project version <project-descriptor>` is an error.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml project release


.. _lifecycle-production:

Production Life cycle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After :ref:`rolling-out <lifecycle-release>` the new :ref:`release package <registry-package>`
into a registry, it becomes available for the *production life cycle*. In contrast to the
development, the production life cycle no longer needs the project source-code working copy as it
operates solely on that published release package (plus potentially the previously persisted
:ref:`model generations <registry-assets>`).

The production life cycle is either managed in batch mode using the :ref:`CLI <platform-cli>` or
embedded within a :ref:`serving engine <serving>`.

The stages of the production life cycle are:

Train
"""""

Run the :ref:`project pipeline <project-pipeline>` in the :ref:`train-mode <workflow-mode>` to
produce the :ref:`new generation <lifecycle-generation>` and persist it in the :ref:`model registry
<registry>`.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml model train forml-tutorial-titanic

Tune
""""

Run hyper-parameter tuning of the selected pipeline and produce the new *generation* (not
implemented yet).

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml model tune forml-tutorial-titanic

.. todo:: Tuning support is currently still pending.

Apply
"""""

Run the previously trained :ref:`project pipeline <project-pipeline>` in the :ref:`apply-mode
<workflow-mode>` using an existing :ref:`model generation <lifecycle-generation>` (explicit
version or by default the latest) loaded from the :ref:`model registry <registry>`.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml model apply forml-tutorial-titanic

.. seealso::
   In addition to this command-line-based batch mechanism, the :ref:`serving engine <serving>`
   together with the :ref:`application concept <application>` is another way of performing the
   *apply* action of the production life cycle.

Evaluate
""""""""

Perform the :ref:`production performance evaluation <evaluation-perftrack>` based on the
:ref:`evaluation.py component <project-evaluation>` and report the metrics.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml model eval forml-tutorial-titanic
