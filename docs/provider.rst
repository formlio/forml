Providers Library
=================

ForML providers are *plugins* implementing particular functionality defined within the framework
using an abstract interface to decouple itself from specific technologies allowing for greater
operational flexibility.

Providers become available for runtime operations after being :ref:`properly configured
<platform-config>` within the given platform.


.. seealso::
    This page is merely a summary list of all the official providers shipped with ForML. API
    documentation as well as a comprehensive description of their logical concepts is covered
    in individual chapters dedicated to each of the provider types respectively (linked in
    subsections below).


.. _provider-custom:
.. rubric:: Custom Provider Setup

In addition to the existing providers, users might find themselves requiring to implement their
bespoke instances. To avoid having to always release and deploy these providers as true code
artifacts, ForML allows to alternatively treat them in a rather more configuration-like manner.

For this purpose, the standard :ref:`config directories <platform-config>` are valid locations
for hosting python modules with bespoke provider implementations available to the particular runtime
platform.

Following is an example of a custom :ref:`Feed <feed>` setup (even though this one could well be
solved using the existing generic :class:`Alchemy Feed <forml.provider.feed.alchemy.Feed>` or -
given the particular dataset - even more easily using the :class:`openlake:openlake.Lite` feed):

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: ~/.forml/foobar.py
   :linenos:

    from forml import io
    from forml.provider.feed.reader.sql import alchemy
    from openschema import kaggle
    import sqlalchemy


    class Baz(io.Feed):
        """Custom feed example."""

        class Reader(alchemy.Reader):
            """Using the existing SQLAlchemy reader."""

        @property
        def sources(self):
            """This feed can serve just one and only dataset - the ``titanic`` table mapped to
               the ``kaggle.Titanic`` schema."""

            return {kaggle.Titanic: sqlalchemy.table('titanic')}

This custom ``foobar:Baz`` feed provider can now be added to the :ref:`platform config
<platform-config>`:

.. code-block:: toml
   :caption: ~/.forml/config.toml

    [FEED.foobar]
    provider = "foobar:Baz"
    connection = "sqlite:////tmp/foobar.db"


Model Registries
----------------

ForML delegates responsibility for :ref:`model persistence <registry>` to model registry providers
implementing the abstract :class:`forml.io.asset.Registry` base class.

.. autosummary::
   :template: provider.rst
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree: _auto

   forml.provider.registry.filesystem.volatile.Registry
   forml.provider.registry.filesystem.posix.Registry
   forml.provider.registry.mlflow.Registry


Runners
-------

The actual execution of the :ref:`ForML workflows <workflow>` is performed by the
:ref:`pipeline runner <runner>` providers implementing the :class:`forml.runtime.Runner` base class.

.. autosummary::
   :template: provider.rst
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree: _auto

   forml.provider.runner.dask.Runner
   forml.provider.runner.graphviz.Runner
   forml.provider.runner.pyfunc.Runner
   forml.provider.runner.spark.Runner


Feeds
-----

To decouple projects from any physical data sources, ForML is using a generic :ref:`query DSL <dsl>`
working with logical schemas that only at runtime get resolved to actual data provided by the
platform-configured :ref:`set of feeds <feed>` implementing the :class:`forml.io.Feed` base class.

.. autosummary::
   :template: provider.rst
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree: _auto

   forml.provider.feed.alchemy.Feed
   forml.provider.feed.monolite.Feed

.. rubric:: External Providers

+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| :class:`openlake:openlake.Lite`  | ForML feed providing access to a number of public datasets. |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+


Sinks
-----

Reciprocally to the Feeds_ system, ForML is using :ref:`sink <sink>` providers for submitting the
:ref:`workflow <workflow>` results according to the particular implementation of the
:class:`forml.io.Sink` base class.

.. autosummary::
   :template: provider.rst
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree: _auto

   forml.provider.sink.null.Sink
   forml.provider.sink.stdout.Sink


Application Inventories
-----------------------

For managing the high-level :ref:`application descriptors <application>` driving the :ref:`serving
<serving>` layer, ForML defers to the :ref:`inventory <inventory>` providers implementing the
:class:`forml.io.asset.Inventory` base class.

.. autosummary::
   :template: provider.rst
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree: _auto

   forml.provider.inventory.posix.Inventory


Gateways
--------

The :ref:`serving layer <serving>` representing one of the possible :ref:`execution mechanisms
<platform-execution>` is using the gateway providers implementing the :class:`forml.runtime.Gateway`
base class.

.. autosummary::
   :template: provider.rst
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree: _auto

   forml.provider.gateway.rest.Gateway
