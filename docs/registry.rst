Model Persistence
=================

During their :ref:`life cycles <lifecycle>`, ForML :ref:`projects <project>` produce specific
*artifacts* as their runtime deliverables. To store these artifacts, ForML uses :ref:`model
registry providers <registry-providers>` as the persistence layer managing the models at rest.

.. note::
   We use the term *model* more loosely including not just the involved *estimators* but
   essentially any :ref:`stateful actor <actor>` in the entire pipeline.

.. _registry-artifacts:

Project Artifacts
-----------------

The two types of artifacts requiring persistence are *code* in form of the :ref:`release package
<registry-package>` and *states* stored as :ref:`model generation assets <registry-assets>`.

The following diagram illustrates the logical hierarchy of the persistence layer based on a
particular instance of the ``posix`` registry provider holding a single :ref:`project <project>`
``forml-titanic-example`` with two :ref:`releases <lifecycle-release>` ``0.1.dev0`` and
``1.3.dev12`` - the first one having two :ref:`generations <lifecycle-generation>` with two
*model assets* each and the later just one generation with three model assets:

.. _registry-package:

Release Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The deployable project *code arrangement* produced :ref:`upon release <lifecycle-release>` from
within the :ref:`development life cycle <lifecycle-development>` is the binary :class:`ForML
package <forml.project.Package>`. It is a :doc:`zipfile object <python:library/zipfile>`
(typically a file with the ``.4ml`` suffix) containing all the project :ref:`principal components
<project-principal>` bundled together with all of its *runtime code dependencies* (as declared in
the :ref:`project descriptor <project-descriptor>`) plus some additional *metadata* (:class:`ForML
package manifest <forml.project.Manifest>`).

Each ForML package is published with an explicit version as specified in the :ref:`project
descriptor <project-descriptor>` at the time of release. All registry providers require packages
of the same project to have unique monotonically increasing version numbers.

.. _registry-staging:

Package Staging
"""""""""""""""

Registry providers might internally persist packages in an arbitrary format. In order to launch
their code using a :ref:`runner <runner>`, however, they need to be
:meth:`mounted <forml.io.asset.Registry.mount>` and exposed using a posix file system path known as
the *staging path* that is reachable from all runner nodes (for distributed deployment this implies
shared network posix file system).

.. _registry-assets:

Model Generation Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All :ref:`stateful actors <actor-type>` involved in a :ref:`project life cycle <lifecycle>`
require their internal state acquired during :ref:`training <workflow-mode>` to be persisted
using the model registry. States produced from the same training process represent the *model
generation assets* and every single follow-up training is leading to a new :ref:`generation
advancement <lifecycle-generation>`.

Generations are implicitly versioned using an integer sequence number starting from ``1``
(relatively to the same *release*) incremented upon every generation advancement.

Since each actor can implement an arbitrary way of :meth:`representing its own state
<forml.flow.Actor.get_state>`, the model assets are persisted as monolithic binary blobs with
a transparent structure.

The metadata associated with each generation is provided in form of an :class:`asset.Tag
<forml.io.asset.Tag>`.


.. _registry-management:

Content Management
------------------

Content of the registry can be managed using the :ref:`CLI <platform-cli>` as follows (see the
integrated help for full synopsis):

=========================  ===========================
Use case                   Command
=========================  ===========================
New release publishing     ``$ forml project release``
New generation publishing  ``$ forml model train``
Registry content listing   ``$ forml model list``
=========================  ===========================


Persistence API
---------------

Low-level
^^^^^^^^^

The low-level persistence interface is used mainly by the :ref:`registry providers
<registry-providers>`.

.. autoclass:: forml.project.Package

.. autoclass:: forml.project.Manifest

.. autoclass:: forml.io.asset.Tag

.. autoclass:: forml.io.asset.Registry
   :members: mount

High-level
^^^^^^^^^^

The following is the high-level persistence interface as used by the :ref:`runners <runner>`.

.. autoclass:: forml.io.asset.State

.. autoclass:: forml.io.asset.Instance

.. autoclass:: forml.io.asset.Directory

.. autoclass:: forml.io.asset.Project.Key
.. autoclass:: forml.io.asset.Release.Key
.. autoclass:: forml.io.asset.Generation.Key

.. _registry-providers:

Registry Providers
------------------

ForML comes with a number of :ref:`providers <provider>` implementing the
:class:`io.asset.Registry <forml.io.asset.Registry>` interface. To make them available
for the ForML runtime, selected providers need to be configured within the common :ref:`platform
setup <platform>` using the ``[REGISTRY.*]`` sections.

The official registry providers are:
