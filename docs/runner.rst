.. _runner:

Pipeline Runner
===============

To perform particular :ref:`life cycle actions <lifecycle>` of any given :ref:`project <project>`,
ForML delegates the :ref:`workflow topology <topology>` compiled into a :ref:`portable set
of instructions <topology-compiler>` to a selected :ref:`runner provider <runner-providers>` for
its execution.

The runner is the foremost elementary component of the :ref:`runtime platform <platform>` carrying
out the compute function on top of the entire IO layer (represented by the :ref:`feed <feed>`,
:ref:`sink <sink>`, and :ref:`registry <registry>` providers).

The pluggable provider model of the runner concept conveniently allows to mix and match different
processing technologies for different workloads as these typically come with varying
performance criteria regarding the particular use case (e.g. low latency for online serving vs
large throughput for offline training).

There are three different :ref:`execution mechanisms <platform-execution>` each engaging the
pipeline runners under the hood.
