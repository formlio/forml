Tutorials
=========

The easiest way to get started with ForML is to go through its practical tutorials presented in
this chapter. Assuming you have already installed ForML as per the :ref:`installation instructions
<install>` (ensure you have at least the ``dask``, ``graphviz`` and ``rest`` :ref:`extra features
<install-extras>` installed) and ideally also familiarized yourself with the :ref:`ForML
principles <principles>`, you can now go straight through the following list of step-by-step
examples demonstrating the ForML capabilities.

.. _tutorial-setup:
.. rubric:: Common Setup

The tutorials depend on the following initial environment configuration:

Assuming you have no existing :ref:`feeds <feed>` configured in your system yet, let's install
the :doc:`Openlake feed <openlake:install>`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --constraints https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formlio/openlake/main/constraints.txt 'openlake[kaggle]'


Let's now configure the local ForML :ref:`platform <platform>` by adding the following content to
your :file:`~/.forml/config.toml`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tutorials/config.toml
  :language: toml
  :start-after: # under the License.

.. important::
    Make sure to configure your Kaggle API access token under the :file:`~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
    as described in the `Kaggle API Documentation <https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api>`_ to get
    access to all of the datasets used in this tutorial.

Your local environment is now ready to perform all the runtime actions demonstrated in these
tutorials.

.. _tutorial-list:
.. rubric:: Tutorials List

The list of available tutorials is:

* The :ref:`Titanic challenge <titanic>` is a *complete* end-to-end ML :ref:`project <project>`
  implemented using ForML.
* :ref:`Pipeline demos <demos>` represent a set of small *snippets* demonstrating the :ref:`pipeline
  composition <workflow>` fundamentals.
