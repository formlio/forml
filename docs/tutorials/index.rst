Tutorials
=========

The easiest way to get started with ForML is to go through its practical tutorials presented in
this chapter. Assuming you've already installed ForML as per the :doc:`installation instructions
<../install>` and ideally also familiarized yourself with the :doc:`ForML concepts <../concept>`,
you can now go straight through the following list of step-by-step examples demonstrating the
ForML capabilities.

.. important::
    Before proceeding with any of the tutorials, make sure to configure your environment as per the
    :doc:`common setup instructions<common>`.

The list of the available tutorials is as follows:

* :doc:`Pipeline demos <demos>` is a set of small *snippets* demonstrating the pipeline
  composition fundamentals.
* :doc:`Titanic challenge <titanic>` is a *complete* end-to-end ML project implemented using ForML.
