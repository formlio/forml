Titanic Challenge
=================

There is a complete ForML project available under ``tutorials/titanic/``. It is the famous `Titanic Challenge
<https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>`_. We will use it here to demonstrate the typical ForML usecases.


Initial Setup
-------------

Before diving into the actual implementation, we need to go through a couple of setup procedures.


Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following shell command to create the initial :doc:`project structure<../../project>`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml init --requirements=openschema,pandas,scikit-learn,numpy forml-tutorial-titanic

You should see a directory structure like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tree forml-tutorial-titanic
    forml-tutorial-titanic
    ├── application.py
    ├── setup.py
    └── titanic
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── evaluation.py
        ├── pipeline.py
        └── source.py


Source Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's edit the :file:`source.py` component supplying the project :ref:`datasource descriptor <project-source>` with
a :doc:`DSL query<../../dsl>` against the particular :py:class:`Titanic schema from the Openschema catalog
<openschema:openschema.kaggle.Titanic>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tutorials/titanic/titanic/source.py
  :language: python
  :start-at: import


Evaluation Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, we fill-in the :ref:`evaluation descriptor <project-evaluation>` within the :file:`evaluation.py` which
involves specifying the :doc:`evaluation strategy <../../evaluation>` including the particular metric:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tutorials/titanic/titanic/evaluation.py
  :language: python
  :start-at: import


Exploration with Jupyter
------------------------

See the tutorial notebook stored in the demo project under ``examples/tutorial/titanic/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb`` for
a step-by-step examples of working with ForML project in Jupyter.

Further details on the interactive style of work with ForML in general can be found in the :doc:`interactive` sections.


Lifecycle Actions
-----------------

We will exercise the standard :doc:`lifecycle <lifecycle>` actions.

Development Lifecycle Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Change directory to the root of the ``titanic`` project working copy.
2. Let's first run all the operator unit tests to confirm the project is in good shape:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ python3 setup.py test
        running test
        TestNaNImputer
        Test of Invalid Params ... ok
        TestNaNImputer
        Test of Not Trained ... ok
        TestNaNImputer
        Test of Valid Imputation ... ok
        TestTitleParser
        Test of Invalid Params ... ok
        TestTitleParser
        Test of Invalid Source ... ok
        TestTitleParser
        Test of Valid Parsing ... ok
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Ran 6 tests in 0.591s

        OK

3. Try running the ``train`` mode on the *Graphviz* runner (called ``visual`` in our config ) to see the train task
   graph:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ python3 setup.py train --runner visual

    .. image:: ../../_static/images/titanic-train.png
       :align: center

4. Run the ``eval`` mode on the (default) *Dask* runner (called ``compute`` in our config) to get the
   cross-validation score:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ python3 setup.py eval
        0.8379888268156425

5. Create the project package artifact and upload it to the (default) filesystem registry (assuming the same release
   doesn't already exist - otherwise increment the project version in the ``setup.py``):

    .. code-block:: console

        $ python3 setup.py bdist_4ml upload

   This should publish the project into your local filesystem forml registry making it available for the production
   lifecycle. This becomes the first published :ref:`release <concept-persistence>` of this project versioned (according
   to the version from :ref:`setup.py <project-setup>` as ``0.1.dev0``)

Production Lifecycle Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Production lifecycle doesn't need the project working copy so feel free to change the directory to another location
before executing the commands.

1. List the local registry confirming the project has been published as its first release:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ forml model list
        forml-example-titanic
        $ forml model list forml-example-titanic
        0.1.dev0
        $ forml model list forml-example-titanic 0.1.dev0

   The output shows the project artifact is available in the registry as a release ``0.1.dev0`` not having any
   generation yet (the last command not producing any output).

3. Train the project (using the default runner as per our config) to create the first generation of its models and list
   the registry to confirm it got persisted:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ forml model train forml-example-titanic
        $ forml model list forml-example-titanic 0.1.dev0
        1

   Now we have our first generation of the titanic models available in the registry.

3. Apply the trained generation to get the predictions:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ forml model apply forml-example-titanic
        [0.38717846 0.37779938 0.38008973 0.37771585 0.3873835  0.38832168
        0.38671783 0.38736506 0.38115396 0.37622997 0.37642134 0.37965842
        ...
        0.3824376  0.38695502 0.38891135 0.38688363 0.38726499 0.37714804
        0.3860998  0.38041917 0.3885712 ]

4. Run the ``apply`` mode alternatively on the *Graphviz* runner to explore its task graph:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ forml model -R visual apply forml-example-titanic

    .. image:: ../../_static/images/titanic-apply.png


Deployment and Serving
----------------------

There is a complete ForML project available under ``examples/tutorial/titanic/``. It is the famous `Titanic Challenge
<https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>`_. We will use it here to demonstrate the typical ForML usecases.

Before you start, please make sure to install ForML as per the :doc:`installation instructions <../install>` and ideally
also get familiar with the :doc:`ForML concepts <../concept>`.
