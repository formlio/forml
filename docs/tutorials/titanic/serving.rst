Deployment and Serving
======================

With all the :ref:`lifecycle actions <lifecycle>` simply :doc:`at our fingertips <lifecycle>`,
let's now focus on deploying the project as a :ref:`ForML application <application>` making it
available for :ref:`serving <serving>`.


Creating and Publishing the Application Descriptor
--------------------------------------------------

ForML applications are :ref:`implemented <application-implementation>` in form of a *descriptor*
instance defined within a *Python module*. Due to the potentially non-exclusive nature of the
:ref:`project-application relationship <application-prjrelation>`, this module might in general
need to be maintained out of the project scope but for the sake of this tutorial let's assume a
direct 1:1 relationship so that we can keep it along with the project sources in a module called
:file:`application.py`. Our top-level project structure is then going to look as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ls -1p forml-tutorial-titanic
    application.py
    notebooks/
    pyproject.toml
    tests/
    titanic/


For simplicity, we choose to :ref:`implement the application <application-implementation>` in
the most basic (yet full-featured) manner by reusing the existing :class:`application.Generic
<forml.application.Generic>` descriptor and passing its instance to :func:`application.setup()
<forml.application.setup>` for registration. Note this simplistic setup requires the application
name to match the project name (in order to select the relevant assets from the :ref:`model
registry <registry>`):

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tutorials/titanic/application.py
   :caption: application.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python
   :start-after: # under the License.

That's all it takes to implement a simple application descriptor. It can now be deployed by
the means of publishing into a :ref:`platform-configured <platform-config>` application
:ref:`inventory <inventory>`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml application put application.py
    $ forml application list
    forml-tutorial-titanic


Serving
-------

The easiest way to expose our model for serving is to spin up a particular :ref:`serving gateway
<serving-gateway>` provider linked through the :ref:`platform configuration <platform-config>` to
the same :ref:`inventory <inventory>` and :ref:`registry <registry>` holding our application and
models respectively.

The configured gateway (the :class:`rest.Gateway <forml.provider.gateway.rest.Gateway>` in our case)
can be started simply using the CLI:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml application serve
    INFO:     Started server process [568798]
    INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
    INFO:     Application startup complete.
    INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Note the gateway is capable of serving any application in the linked inventory.

Let's explore the capabilities using manual ``curl`` queries:

#. Querying a non-existent application ``foobarbaz``:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/foobarbaz
       Application foobarbaz not found in Dispatch-registry

#. Querying our ``forml-titanic-example`` application using a *JSON* encoded payload:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[{"Pclass":1, "Name":"Foo", "Sex": "male", "Age": 34, "SibSp": 3, "Parch": 2, "Ticket": "13", "Fare": 10.1, "Cabin": "123", "Embarked": "S"}]' http://127.0.0.1:8080/forml-tutorial-titanic
       [{"c0":0.3459976655}]

#. Making the same query but requesting the result to be encoded as CSV:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: text/csv' -d '[{"Pclass":1,"Name":"Foo", "Sex": "male", "Age": 34, "SibSp": 3, "Parch": 2, "Ticket": "13", "Fare": 10.1, "Cabin": "123", "Embarked": "S"}]' http://127.0.0.1:8080/forml-tutorial-titanic
       c0
       0.34599766550668526

#. Making the same query but sending the payload in the *pandas-split* (JSON) format and requesting
   the result as (JSON) *values*:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json; format=pandas-split' -H 'Accept: application/json; format=pandas-values' -d '{"columns": ["Pclass", "Name", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Ticket", "Fare", "Cabin", "Embarked"], "data": [[1, "Foo", "male", 34, 3, 2, 13, 10.1, "123", "S"]]}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/forml-tutorial-titanic
       [[0.3459976655]]

That concludes this Titanic Challenge tutorial, from here you can continue to the other
:ref:`available tutorials <tutorials>` or browse the general :doc:`ForML documentation
