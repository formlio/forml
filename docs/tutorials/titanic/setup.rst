Initial Setup
=============

Before diving into the actual implementation, we need to go through a couple of setup procedures
(in addition to those :ref:`common to all tutorials <tutorial-setup>`).


Starting a New Project
----------------------

Run the following shell command to create the initial :ref:`project structure <project>`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ forml project init --requirements=openschema,pandas,scikit-learn,numpy --package titanic forml-tutorial-titanic

You should see a directory structure like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tree forml-tutorial-titanic
    forml-tutorial-titanic
    ├── pyproject.toml
    └── titanic
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── evaluation.py
        ├── pipeline.py
        └── source.py


Source Definition
-----------------

Let's edit the :file:`source.py` component supplying the project :ref:`data source descriptor
<project-source>` with a :ref:`DSL query <dsl>` against the particular :py:class:`Titanic
schema from the Openschema catalog <openschema:openschema.kaggle.Titanic>`. Note the essential call
to the :func:`project.setup() <forml.project.setup>` at the end registering the component within
the framework.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tutorials/titanic/titanic/source.py
  :caption: titanic/source.py
  :linenos:
  :language: python
  :start-at: import


Evaluation Definition
---------------------

Finally, we fill-in the :ref:`evaluation descriptor <project-evaluation>` within the
:file:`evaluation.py` which involves specifying the :ref:`evaluation strategy <evaluation>`
including the particular metric. The file again ends with a call to the :func:`project.setup()
<forml.project.setup>` to register the component within the framework.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tutorials/titanic/titanic/evaluation.py
  :caption: titanic/evaluation.py
  :linenos:
  :language: python
  :start-at: import
