Titanic data source.

This is one of the main _formal_ forml components (along with `pipeline` and `evaluation`) that's being looked up by
the forml loader. In this case it is implemented as a python module but it could be as well a package
`source/__init__.py` (to potentially split it into additional informal submodules).
